Your goal is : {goal}
You previously made a plan, agents are currently working on it.
The last agent working on task: {id}, did the following work:
{last_agent_work}
Agent {id} work was a {tool_success_str} according to system interpreter.
{next_task}
Is the work done for task {id} leading to success or failure ? Did an agent fail with a task?
If agent work was good: answer "NO_UPDATE"
If agent work is leading to failure: update the plan.
If a task failed add a task to try again or recover from failure. You might have near identical task twice.
plan should be within ```json like before.
You need to rewrite the whole plan, but only change the tasks after task {id}.
Make the plan the same length as the original one or with only one additional step.
Do not change past tasks. Change next tasks.
